# Framework

The inventory was designed with the intention to move towards a more generic / standalone structure so it can be integrated into any framework without too much hassle. I will be writing a guide for manually setting up support _sometime soonâ„¢_. In the mean-time, it will work without any alterations if using the latest updates to **[ESX Legacy](https://github.com/esx-framework/esx-legacy)**.

Experimental support for [qb-core](https://github.com/qbcore-framework/qb-core) has been added, but requires a recent installation. Do not expect 100% compatibility or support.

# Config

Refer to the [documentation](https://overextended.github.io/docs/ox_inventory/) setting your config.
When set, you can add the following to your 'server.cfg'

```
exec @ox_inventory/config.cfg
ensure ox_inventory
```

# Logging

The included logging module utilises datadog to store logging data, which can be expanded for improved analytics and metrics. Register an account at [datadoghq](https://www.datadoghq.com/).
The _free plan_ is enough for most user's purposes and provides far more utility than the typical weird discord logs utilised in other resources.

Once you have registered, generate an API key and add `set datadog:key 'apikey'` to your server config.
